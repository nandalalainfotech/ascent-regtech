						What is RegTech?</h4>
					<p class="card-text mt-4" style="font-size: 19px;">
						RegTech (Regulatory Technology) is the application of emerging technology to improve the way
						businesses manage regulatory compliance. Though relatively young, RegTech is maturing rapidly.
						RegTech companies are now engaging machine learning, natural language processing, blockchain,
						AI, and other technologies in order to bring the power of digital transformation to the world of
						regulatory compliance</p>

					<p style="font-size: 17px;">Rule changes have increased <span style="color:  #03d5cc;">500
							percent</span> in the last decade. A new
						regulatory update is implemented every 7 minutes, according to Thomson Reuters’ <span
							style="color:  #03d5cc;">2018 Cost of
							Compliance Report.</span> Fines for non-compliance are becoming more frequent and more
						severe. In 2019,
						the  <span style="color:  #03d5cc;">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</span> alone issued<span style="color:  #03d5cc;">862 enforcement actions</span>, ordering
						those in violation to pay more than $4.3 billion combined. The U.K.’s Financial Conduct
						Authority (FCA)<span style="color:  #03d5cc;">levied its largest personal fine ever</span>, also in 2019.

					</p>

					<p style="font-size: 17px;">These challenges have brought to bear a booming new industry called
						RegTech, encompassing a wide range of tools that help organizations stay above the rising tide
						of regulation and execute their business activities in a more compliant way.
					</p>

					<p style="font-size: 17px;">But what do these solutions do, and more importantly, how can they help
						Risk and Compliance teams in financial services with the complex job of managing regulatory
						compliance? Below, we offer a guide to the young and growing RegTech industry – explaining how

					<h1 style="font-size:32px;font-weight: bolder;"><strong>A Brief History of RegTech</strong></h1>
					<h1 style="font-size: 24px;font-weight: bolder;">The dawn of a new regulatory era</h1>
					<p style="font-size: 17px;">The year was 2008 and the financial world was in chaos. Lehman Brothers
						had imploded, the federal government took over Fannie and Freddie, and money-market funds broke
						the buck.

					</p>

					<p style="font-size: 17px;">The world was in the throes of the worst financial crisis since the
						Great Depression.
					</p>

					<p style="font-size: 23px;font-weight:400;">The federal government needed to revive the public’s
						trust in our
						financial institutions. That meant ushering in a new era of regulatory oversight.
					</p>

					<p style="font-size: 17px;">This new era was epitomized by one single and massive piece of
						legislation: <span style="color:  #03d5cc;">the Dodd-Frank
							Financial Reform Act.</span></p>
					<p style="font-size: 17px;">Dodd-Frank would mark a sea of change in the world of regulatory
						compliance. Based on President Obama’s proposal for a <span style="color:  #03d5cc;">“sweeping overhaul of the United States
							financial regulatory system, a transformation on a scale not seen since the reforms that
							followed the Great Depression</span>,” Dodd-Frank was undeniably expansive and ambitious. But the
						success of the Act is more debatable. </p>

					<p style="font-size: 17px;">To many, Dodd-Frank seemed like a half-measure that mended the
						proverbial fence only after the horse had escaped the corral. Many financial institutions saw it
						as overzealous and set on putting up unnecessary guardrails. To the public, it seemed
						disconnected from their desire to see big bank executives pay for the reckless behavior that had
						led to the financial crisis.</p>
					<p style="font-size: 17px;">Effective or not in its original intent, Dodd-Frank would mark a turning
						point in the industry: the moment the regulatory pendulum swung back from the under-regulated
						era pre-Global Financial Crisis to the over-regulated era that would follow.</p>
					<p style="font-size: 17px;">The massive tolls this new regulatory era has brought to bear on
						financial institutions is staggering.</p>

					<h1 style="font-size: 23px;font-weight:bolder;"> The Rise of AI</h1>
					<p style="font-size: 17px;">Meanwhile, another tidal shift was beginning to disrupt nearly every
						vertical (though some much faster than others) — the rise of artificial intelligence.

					</p>

					<p style="font-size: 17px;">In the 2010s, AI began to develop extremely rapidly. Deep learning and
						neural networks made it possible to “teach” a system how to complete a task using a large data
						set of examples rather than through task-specific programming.
					</p>

					<p style="font-size: 17px;">The distinction has wide-ranging implications. The process of writing a
						program is extremely labor-intensive. With deep learning, programmers can instead feed
						algorithms data sets to help them learn.

					<h4><b>The RegTech Revolution</b></h4>

					<p style="font-size: 17px;">It was at this junction of the looming regulatory burden and the rise of
						AI that RegTech was born.</p>
					<p style="font-size: 17px;">Initially, the financial services industry met RegTech with a healthy
						dose of skepticism. The solutions RegTech providers promised were enticing, but the world of
						regulatory compliance is vast and complex, and its margin of error is non-existent. RegTech
						companies would need to prove that their solutions worked before financial firms would be
						willing to bet on them.
					</p>
					<p style="font-size: 17px;">Here is when investors stepped in. They understood the depth of the
						opportunity and were willing to invest capital to help turn it into reality. </p>

					<p style="font-size: 17px;">A lot of capital, it turns out. And very, very quickly.</p>

					<p style="font-size: 17px;">According to<span style="color:  #03d5cc;">  RegTech Analyst</span>, in 2015 there were 149 RegTech investment
						deals across the world, totaling $1.1 billion. Just four years later those numbers had jumped up
						to 317 deals totaling $8.5 billion.</p>
					<p style="font-size: 17px;">Those deals have continued to average larger and larger amounts. In
						2015, only 3.4 percent of deals were valued at or over $50 million. By 2019, <span style="color:  #03d5cc;"> that percentage had
							shot up 17.3 percent of deals</span>.
					</p>
					<p style="font-size: 17px;">This investment and maturation helped push RegTech solutions past pilots
						and out of the innovation phase, so that they could begin operationalizing benefits in a
						real-life environment. This, in turn, helped RegTech providers convince financial institutions
						that the value they now offered was real and meaningful. </p>

					<p style="font-size: 23px;">“RegTech is no longer just for early adopters. We’re starting to see the

					For financial services, the benefits of RegTech are substantial:
					<div class="container">
						<p style="font-size: 17px;margin-top: 15px;"><b>» Efficiency gains — </b>As regulation continues
							to
							grow, it becomes nearly impossible for compliance personnel to keep up without the aid of
							technology. Technology, capable of processing a high volume of data at incredible speeds,
							can
							quickly parse and analyze raw legal text and extract valuable insights. </p>
						<p style="font-size: 17px;"><b>» Greater accuracy and comprehensiveness —</b> Manual, siloed
							processes tend to create gaps in the compliance operation, leading to human error and
							increased
							exposure. Implementing the right technology (and integrating those technologies thoughtfully
							where necessary) shores up gaps and creates a streamlined compliance process.
						</p>
						<p style="font-size: 17px;"><b>» Greater internal alignment — </b>Technology tools enable
							greater
							transparency throughout the business, connecting once siloed people and processes. The
							result is
							better insights between business units that can be shared faster, which also leads to a
							stronger
							culture of compliance. </p>
						<p style="font-size: 17px;"><b>» Improved risk management —</b> Many RegTech tools help protect
							against various types of risk, including market abuse, cyber attacks, and fraud, by
							monitoring

							least in the foreseeable future). While this may seem like a disheartening reality, it is in
							fact an advantage for financial firms. With a myriad of solutions available, firms can build
							a fully integrated technology stack that is unique and optimal for their specific business
							rather than attempt to use a “one-size-fits-all’ approach that would be impossible due to
							the massive complexity and scope of regulation.
						</p>

						<h2><b>Example RegTech Use Cases</b></h2>
						<p style="font-size: 17px;">Beyond the clear operational benefits to businesses, RegTech also
							has significant implications for the market as a whole. Historically, spurring business and
							protecting consumers have been viewed as two objectives that are diametrically opposed, at
							least from a regulatory standpoint. Issuing less regulation is often seen as the way to give
							businesses more freedom to generate real value and profit, but this all too often comes at
							the expense of the consumer. The result is an environment that is ripe for over-regulation,
							or so businesses fear. </p>
						<p style="font-size: 17px;">RegTech’s power is in subverting this dichotomy. RegTech helps
							create a world where it is easier for businesses to comply, unlocking both opportunity and
							business value without compromising consumer protection. And that makes a better world, for
							everyone. </p>
